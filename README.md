# PanicSystem - BARELY MAINTAINED.  CODE NOT COMPILED TO NEXUS YMMV
Forked from RealityMachina's fork (https://github.com/RealityMachina/Basic-Panic-System) of mpstark's PunchinOut mod (https://github.com/Mpstark/PunchinOut).

Design improvements by don Zappo, balancing and testing by ganimal, and coding by gnivler.

Huge thanks to JetBrains for supporting this project and OSS development.

Coded using JetBrains Rider IDE.

## Installation

Supported by HBS ModLoader, but without the custom icons you can currently get using ModTek instead.

## General Details

The mod.json is extremely configurable, now including strings for lazy "localization" or custom phrases.

Manual ejection can be optionally blocked, either by pilot tag(s) or by panic status (eg, no manual ejection at Confident).

There are four states for a pilot to be in: Confident, Unsettled, Stressed, and Panicked.  These are customizable

Panic rolls are made when sufficient damage is dealt.  This roll considers multiple factors to calculate a saving throw and a failure will increase panic by one level.  Guts and Tactics can affect this, as well as Quirks from don Zappo's [Pilot Quirks mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/battletech/mods/282/).  Lance morale also comes into play.  Rolling 100 on a saving throw will reduce panic level by one state.  Succeeding all saving throws in a turn will improve panic state by one level as well.

Panic save failures lead to ejection rolls when the target is at Panicked state.  Similar calculations are performed to determine a saving throw, where a failure will eject the pilot.

The panic states affect the pilot's to-hit and to-hit-against stats as follows, by default (also configurable).

### Panic Effects (defaults)

Panic State|To Hit|To Hit Against
-----------|------|--------------
Confident|0|0
Unsettled|+1|0
Stressed| +1|-1
Panicked| +2|-2

### Special Cases

Pilots with one health left and a mostly destroyed mech will automatically starting rolling for ejection, skipping panic saving throws.  Pilots who are alone and face insurmountable odds will also skip panic throws and start rolling for ejection.  These are also configurable.

### Optional Vehicle Panic

Enable it in the mod.json if you want to use this.
When sufficient damage is inflicted, they will make panic saves where a failure jumps immediately to panicked.
When panicked and failing more saving throws they will flee and self destruct.
